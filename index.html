	        		<span class="drop-cap">T</span><b>he police massacre in Dallas was harrowing in a number of ways. It was the worst attack on police officers since 9/11. And it was also the first time a police robot had been used to kill a suspect. </b>
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		That use of a robot raises questions about the way police adopt and use new technologies. While many police forces have adopted robots for uses like bomb detonation or delivery of non-lethal force like tear gas, using one to kill a suspect is at least highly unusual and quite possibly unprecedented.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		“Robot” is actually a misnomer in this case, as they are technically not robots. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a robot is “a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically." Bomb disposal robots cannot perform contextual decision-making or operate by themselves. Instead, bomb disposal robots are more accurately defined as drones, much like unmanned vehicles, as they are remotely controlled by a human operator from afar.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
		        	The original bomb disposal robots were controlled by a series of ropes. But, as technology advanced, a telecommunications cable was used to transmit commands to the robot’s electrical systems. However, cables gave the bomb disposal robot a restricted operational radius. There was also the risk of the cable becoming caught or tangled on objects – much like you might encounter with a garden hose or a vacuum cleaner.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
		        	This is an important note, as the design of bomb disposal robots has changed remarkably little since they were first created. The core idea remains the same. Whilst the technology has become smaller and more robust, bomb disposal robots are still tracked, human-controlled robots. And they're capable of a variety of law enforcement-related tasks.

				<p>
					As with much law enforcement technology, robots joined the ranks of police and SWAT teams after a stint in the military.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		Bomb robots — known formally as explosive ordnance disposal, or EOD, robots — <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3497683.stm">made their debut in Northern Ireland in the 1970s.</a> They didn't become widely used by the U.S. until the 1990s, with two of the first models designed by iRobot, the same company that created the Roomba, a robot vacuum cleaner.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		These robots became widely used by U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq to deal with improvised explosive devices. Peter W. Singer, an expert in military technology and think tank strategist, describes this practice — which used a cheap bomb disposal robot called the MARCbot — in an essay in the book The Changing Character of War:
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		"The MARCbot is not just notable for its small size; it was the first ground robot to draw blood in Iraq. One unit of US soldiers jury-rigged their MARCbots to carry Claymore anti-personnel mines. If they thought an insurgent was hiding in an alley, they would send a MARCbot down first, and if they found someone waiting in ambush, take him out with the Claymore. Of course, each insurgent killed in this fashion meant $5,000 worth of blown-up robot parts, but so far the army has not billed the soldiers."

					There are more than 2,000 ground robots fighting alongside flesh-and-blood forces in Afghanistan, according to Lt. Col. Dave Thompson, the Marine Corps’ top robot-handler. If his figures are right, it means one in 50 U.S. troops in Afghanistan isn’t even a human being. And America’s swelling ranks of groundbot warriors are being used in new, unexpected, life-saving ways.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		But how many of those are sitting on a shelf in the battalion supply room because they’re too flimsy for combat, too dumb to contribute to the fight or simply unneeded?
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
		        	In other words, for the foreseeable future groundbots will be limited to missions where human operators can closely supervise them — unlike airbots, some of which can already fly many missions with very little human guidance. We likely won’t be seeing totally robotic ground convoys or robot snipers any time soon.

		       	    <h4>How can a robot disarm a suspect?</h4>
		       		<p>
						The robot used in Dallas was reportedly a jury-rig of a remotely operated surveillance robot. This doesn't mean it was made from scratch, but rather using the system in a way different than the initial design. Steve Ijames, recently retired assistant chief of police in Springfield, Missouri, and a recognized expert in SWAT tactics, describes how two different ways the robot may have killed the suspect.

					Robots used to defuse bombs have a gun—some are 50-caliber, some are 12-gauge guns—that shoot a payload at the bomb; usually water, he says. “A column of water shot like a rifle bullet … at high velocity, blows things up. They could very well have shot him with one of those and it would have sure killed him,” Ijames says.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
					But police often breach doors in a similar way, which would be necessary if Johnson was barricaded behind something. That’s the second possibility. “A lot of breaching done in law enforcement is done with what’s called a water-impulse charge,” he says, “where you literally take something like an IV-size bag of normal saline water and set an explosive charge on one side and you would smack the door with the high-speed water.” If this is what happened, Johnson was either killed by the overpressure from that explosion or injuries caused by projectiles launched at high speed.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
					To illustrate the speed, Ijames says a 9mm round from a police handgun soars at about 1,100 feet per second. The rifle the suspect was shooting last night, he says, sends a bullet flying at about 3,000 feet per second. An explosive charge used to cut open a door or wall would cause the door material to travel at more than 25,000 feet per second. Those flying projectiles would have been enough to kill Johnson.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
					But so could the pressure from the blast alone. When a supersonic blast of air from an explosion hits a person, it forces liquid inside the body to slam from the front to the back of the body at the same speed as the blast of air. Ijames says this causes internal organs to break.

						Use of remote-controlled devices by law enforcement raises a range of possible questions about when and where they are appropriate. The advent of new police technologies, from the firearm to the Taser, has often resulted in accusations of inappropriate use and recalibration in when police use them. Stoughton pointed out that prior to the Supreme Court’s 1985 decision in Tennessee v. Garner, the “fleeing-felon rule” gave officers the right to use lethal force to prevent a suspect in a serious crime from escaping. But the justices limited the rule, saying that firearms meant the rule was no longer current. Unless either they or civilians are in danger of death or serious bodily harm, police can only use non-lethal force to stop a fleeing felon. Similarly, the adoption of the Taser has raised questions about whether officers are too quick to use the devices when they would be better served to deescalate or use their hands.
		        	</p>
		        	<p class="white">
		        		The questions over police use of remote-controlled devices echoes an existing argument over the military use of such tools. U.S. drone strikes overseas are believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, and the legal justifications for when and where they are used are often hotly contested. In some cases, drone strikes have killed American citizens without due process. Many civil libertarians are troubled by the implications for stateside use. In 2013, Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, mounted a 13-hour filibuster blocking the confirmation John Brennan, President Obama’s nominee to direct the CIA, over the White House’s refusal to say whether it believed it could use military drones to kill American suspects on American soil. Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/03/07/white-house-obama-would-not-use-drones-against-u-s-citizens-on-american-soil/">later wrote Paul</a> to say that the president does not have the authority to do so.
		        	</p>
		        	<p class="white">
		        		ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley says as a legal matter, "the choice of weapon in a decision to use lethal force does not change the constitutional calculus," though robots make it easier to apply deadly force, raising concerns of overuse.
		        	</p>
		        	<p class="white">
		        		"This was a makeshift response to an ongoing emergency," says Joh, "but we shouldn't be surprised if police departments that are watching this situation decide they want to be proactive and have such a robot at hand should a similar crisis arise," she says. "The question going forward is, 'Should this be used again, and when?' "

					Exactly how many bomb detonation robots are being used by police around the country is unclear. The Pentagon's 1033 program, which supplies military weapons and vehicles to law enforcement agencies across the country, distributed 479 EOD robots between 2006 and 2014, according to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/09/02/342494225/mraps-and-bayonets-what-we-know-about-the-pentagons-1033-program">an NPR analysis</a>.

		      	<p class="small-caption">
		        	As of 2015, 201 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies had bought at least one EOD robot through the military's 1033 program. That program distributes excess military equipment to police departments and other agencies across the country. Source: <a href="http://dronecenter.bard.edu/police-robots-in-the-u-s/">Center for the Study of the Drone</a>
		        </p>

	        	<p>
	        		According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://dronecenter.bard.edu/files/2015/06/Police-Robots-Master-List-Sheet2-1.pdf&hl=en_US">a 2015 study</a> by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone, the Dallas County Sheriff's Department bought one EOD robot in 2014 for $10,000. The FBI Dallas Division that year purchased scores of robots at the same per-unit cost, according to the study.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		There may be other robots not accounted for by the 1033 program. Northrop Grumman confirmed to Vice last year that more than 1,100 of its Remotec robots are distributed across the country, used in more than 90 percent of police bomb squads.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
		        	Military expert Peter Singer says that though there’s no doubt law enforcement will increasingly rely on robots, the question of whether they will or should be weaponized remains open. “This is a parallel to the Google [self-driving] car issue,” Singer says. “There are things that the technology can do. Now we’re into the debate not about could, but should it?”
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		Ijames, however, believes that regardless of the debate, lethal police robots will be applied in the future very sparingly. Last night, he says, was not a threshold event but a rare situation in which a unique set of stars aligned. “The reason you have not seen many things like this is that scenarios historically just do not get to that extreme level. There are just other ways to resolve it. We almost always get sights on [the suspect] and shoot him,” he says.
